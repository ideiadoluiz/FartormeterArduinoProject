# FartometerArduinoProject
FartometerArduinoProject is one solution that allows you to make fart battle with your friends, showing how strong are your farts and theirs.

This Arduino code allows you to send and receive data between the arduino device and another device such as a smartphone through bluetooth.

### Usage

For this project, I'm using [SparkFun RedBoard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12757), which I though that it was more worth it to buy their [Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12060) + [RedBearLab BLE Shield](http://redbearlab.com/bleshield/), which is the shield for the **communication** between the devices + [Sound detection sensor](http://www.lightinthebox.com/high-quality-arduino-microphone-sound-detection-sensor-module_p903301.html) + (Methane Gas Sensor MQ-4)[http://leeselectronic.com/product/15529.html].
